## Description

The objective of this project was to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. What needed to be done to achieve the refactor to GraphQL with Apollo server is to: set up Apollo to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API, modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works with GraphQL API, and create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
